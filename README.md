# ClipboardTyper
Written in C++ this code is triggered by the tilde key and performs a keystroke for each character on the clipboard. In some cases keys may not be supported, if they are not check the console for the output key, and submit an issue.

To begin, copy text to your clipboard, select target to repeat key strokes in then press [tilde '`~'] key

The text you intend to copy must not contain the [tilde '`~'] key otherwise it may intermittently stop copying.
